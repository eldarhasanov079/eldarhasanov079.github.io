Hi! I'm **Eldar Hasanov** — a software systems and security engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Advanced Computing (Security & Reliability) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 🎓  
Previously, I earned my B.A. in Computer Science from [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), where I dove deep into systems, theory, and security — while also mentoring, researching, and building impactful tools. 🌉

In recent years, I’ve focused on building **secure, scalable systems** that serve real users and contribute to research. At **UC Berkeley’s [CS Ed R&D Group](https://csed.berkeley.edu/)** (under Prof. Dan Garcia), I led a team of five engineers to develop a **cloud-native analytics platform** used by 300+ students per semester. I built microservices, real-time dashboards, security defenses, and an ETL pipeline for deep packet logging and analysis. 📊  
Alongside that, I served as **tech lead** in the **STAR Research Group**, where I co-authored a tool for interactive graph assessments, published and presented our work at **[ACM SIGCSE](https://sigcse.org/)**, and deployed it to three universities via the open-source [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) platform. 🧠

Outside academia, I've worked across several **startups and research labs in Silicon Valley**. At **Anthems Inc.**, I led the design of Ethereum-based **dynamic NFT smart contracts**. At **1PR**, I built full-stack music analytics apps using React, Django, and Flask. 🎶  
At the **[Lawrence Space Sciences Laboratory](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/)**, I worked on **machine learning models** for NASA Stardust Mission data, improving autoencoder performance on EDS scans. I’ve also engineered **smart contract vulnerability detection tools** under Prof. Dawn Song, and fine-tuned **BERT-based NLP models** for editorial tools used by **New York Times journalists** as a summer researcher at [USC](https://www.cs.usc.edu/). 🛰️🛡️

I’m originally from **Baku, Azerbaijan 🇦🇿**, where I lived until I was 16. I then moved to **Oxford, UK 🇬🇧** for high school, followed by my undergrad in **California 🇺🇸**, and now grad school in **London**. That journey across cultures has shaped not only how I think as an engineer, but also how I see education, global issues, and people. 🌍  
Outside of tech, I’m into **football (the real one ⚽️)**, playing **guitar 🎸**, and overly competitive **board game nights 🎲**.
