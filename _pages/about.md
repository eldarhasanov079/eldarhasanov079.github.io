Hi! I'm **Eldar** — a software systems engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Advanced Computing (Security & Reliability) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Previously, I earned my B.A. in Computer Science from [UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/), where I focused on systems, theory, and security, while also contributing to teaching, research, and the development of educational technology infrastructure.

Recently, I’ve focused on building secure and scalable systems that support real users and contribute to research. At UC Berkeley’s CS Ed R&D Group (under [Prof. Dan Garcia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/#6)), I was a project lead and developer of the instructor dashboard and other core components of GradeView - a cloud-native learning management system (LMS) platform, deployed in CS10 and other Berkeley courses. 

I'm also an open-source contributer to [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the creator of two tools for interactive graph assessments: Graph Construction User Interface (GCUI) and Interactive Graph Assessment Tool (IGAT), both published and presented at [ACM SIGCSE](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3641555.3705123) and [ACM CompEd](https://comped.acm.org/2025/).

During my time in the US, I also had a chance to work with startups and research labs in Silicon Valley, from designing Ethereum-based dynamic NFT music shareables at Anthems Inc. to building full-stack music analytics platforms at 1PR. I was also an ML Research Assistant for NASA’s Stardust Mission group at the [Lawrence Space Sciences Laboratory](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/), and NLP Research Assisstant working on LLMs as a summer researcher at [Information Sciences Institute of USC](https://military.usc.edu/research/information-sciences-institute-isi/).

I am also a frequent participant in hackathons around the world. With over 10 competitions, including such prestigious venues as Berkeley CalHacks, Stanford TreeHacks, and SFHacks, my teams have regularly received winning places and honorable mentions.

I’m originally from Baku, Azerbaijan. In the last year of high school, I moved to Oxford, UK to complete my A Levels, followed by my undergrad in Bay Area, California, and now grad school in London. That journey across cultures has shaped not only how I think as an engineer, but also how I see education, global issues, and people.
