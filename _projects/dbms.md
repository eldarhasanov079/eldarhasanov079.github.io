title: RookieDBMS
description: A lightweight, Java-based DBMS built throughout UC Berkeley’s CS 186 curriculum, implementing core systems concepts across projects 2–5—from B+ tree indexing and joins to concurrency control and ARIES-style crash recovery. It supports efficient query processing, ACID-compliant multi-transaction execution, and fast restart after failures.

Skills: Java 8, disk-based storage, B+ trees, buffer management, join algorithms, query planning, locking, ACID semantics, WAL & ARIES recovery, CLI development.

• Designed and implemented a B+ tree index to support efficient key-based lookup, insertion, deletion, and range scans—achieving logarithmic time complexity and reducing query execution time by up to 50% on synthetic workloads.

• Developed join operators (nested–loop, sort–merge, and Grace hash join) and integrated a simple Selinger-style optimizer, resulting in 2–5× speedups over naive execution plans when processing multi-table queries.

• Built multigranularity locking (shared/exclusive locks with intent modes) to enable ACID-compliant concurrent transactions, validating with TPC-B style benchmarks to support 10× concurrent throughput without conflicts.

• Implemented ARIES-style write-ahead logging (WAL) and recovery protocols, including log truncation, checkpointing, and both REDO/UNDO phases—achieving <2 s restart recovery on 1 M record crash-scenarios.

• Integrated buffer and disk management layers: buffer-pool with LRU/Clock eviction and disk-space subsystem; authored ~3,000 lines of Java, passing 100% of autograder tests and supporting full-stack CLI functionality.
