• Engineered a fully functional single-core OS (PintOS) in C, including comprehensive design documentation
• Developed interrupt handling, including 25 system calls, enabling context switching and service for threads.
• Built robust multithreading functionality with Strict Priority OS Scheduler dynamic stack allocation, using various
synchronization primitives including locks, semaphores, and condition variables, implemented from scratch.
• Implemented a buffer cache with least-recently-used (LRU) functionality, improving memory access speeds.
